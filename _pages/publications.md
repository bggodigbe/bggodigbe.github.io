The Effect of Geographic Diversity on Managerial Earnings Forecasts
======
with Jared Jennings, Hojun Seo, & Lloyd Tanlu, *European Accounting Review,* 2022 [(Link)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09638180.2022.2139738)  <br>

We examine whether geographic diversity – a salient characteristic of the firm’s organizational structure – affects the timing and quality of voluntary disclosure. We find that firms with higher geographic diversity issue earnings forecasts that are more pessimistic, less precise, and less accurate. We also find that firms with higher geographic diversity are more likely to bundle managerial earnings forecasts with the prior quarter’s earnings announcement and less likely to issue forecasts during the quarter. These results are consistent with geographic diversity increasing information acquisition costs associated with providing managerial earnings forecasts. Consistent with these findings, we provide evidence consistent with managers substituting managerial earnings forecasts with firm-initiated non-earnings press releases, which require less information acquisition, and that managerial earnings forecasts are less useful to analysts and investors when geographic diversity is higher. Overall, our findings suggest that a firm’s organizational complexity is a factor that shapes the information environment of the firm.

Directors’ Network Centrality and Earnings Quality
====== 
with Chin Man Chui & Chih-Liang Liu, *Applied Economics,* 2018 [(Link)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2018.1486992) <br>

This study examines whether firm networks can serve as a medium  to propagate financial reporting behavior. We find that earnings quality among firms is low when board networks are channels of incorrect information transmission (including earnings management information). Earnings quality is better for firms with good performance in spite of their networks. These results are robust to controlling for firm information environment and governance quality.
  
Information Spillovers at Earnings Announcements
====== 
with Richard Frankel & MaryJane Rabier, *Working Paper,* 2023 [(Link)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4522028) Revise & Resubmit at Journal of Accounting Research <br>

Research documents price comovements or “spillovers” between focal firms and peer firms at focal-firm-earnings announcements. We find signed and absolute comovements between focal-firm and peer-firm returns are significantly lower at earnings-announcement dates compared to non-announcement dates. These results raise questions about the size of the information externality of financial reporting.

Technology Spillovers, Information Externality, and Stock Price Crash Risk
====== 
with Jeong-Bon Kim, Stephen Teng Sun, & Zilong Zhang, *Working Paper,*, 2023 [(Link)](https://bggodigbe.github.io/files/techspillover.pdf) <br>

Technology spillovers are shown to have important implications on firms’ market valuation and innovation activities. Building on this literature, we show that value-relevant information from technology spillovers significantly reduces the likelihood of the focal firm experiencing a stock price crash. This result is robust to alternative measures and potential endogeneity. Additional analyses suggest that the underlying channel for our finding is not technology spillovers discouraging managers from hoarding bad news; rather, it is technology spillovers significantly reducing the differences of investor opinion, which in turn leads to a lower crash risk. We demonstrate that the informational role of financial analysts is likely to facilitate the convergence of investor opinion. Finally, we find a stronger crash risk-reducing effect of technology spillovers for opaque firms. Our findings provide novel evidence that the information externality associated with peer firms’ technology activities helps to reduce the focal firm’s stock price crash risk. 

Segment Reporting and Corporate Takeovers: Evidence from SFAS 131
====== 
with Stephen Teng Sun, & Zilong Zhang, *Working Paper,*, 2023 [(Link)](https://bggodigbe.github.io/files/sfas131mna.pdf) <br>

Despite an increasing interest in improving the quality of segment reporting, whether and how segment reporting could affect corporate takeovers is an under-studied question. We shed light on this question by exploiting the most recent change in segment reporting from SFAS 14 to SFAS 131 in 1997, which increased segment reporting quality for certain conglomerate firms. Our results show that firms increasing segment reporting quality due to SFAS 131 are more likely to receive takeover bids. Consistent with improved segment reporting reducing information uncertainty in the valuation of the target firm and the merger synergy, such an effect is more salient for firms with ex-ante lower financial reporting quality. We do not find support for the alternative proprietary cost channel or governance channel. We also find that bids for affected target firms are more likely to be completed and take less time to complete. Additionally, deals are more likely to be negotiated and be paid for with cash instead of stocks, again consistent with acquirers’ belief of lower information uncertainty. We also find the market perceives deals involving affected targets to be of higher quality. Taken together, our results show segment reporting has a substantial impact on the market for corporate control. 

Does mandatory disclosure deter insider trading?
====== 
*Working Paper,* 2023 [(Link)](https://bggodigbe.github.io/files/insidertrading.pdf) <br>

This study examines the effect of mandatory disclosure and increased corporate transparency on insider trading. While tempting to conclude that transparency lowers insiders’ information advantage and trade profitability, a compelling counter-intuitive theoretical prediction that increased disclosure crowds out private information production and actually increases profitability of insiders’ trade motivates this study. I exploit the mandatory adoption of SFAS 131 (now ASC 280) – which forced corporate managers to disclose detailed segment information as is internally observed – to document results consistent with causal interpretations. The results show on average, a significant decrease between 5.5 – 6.3 pp (i.e., 79%) in daily alpha for purchase trades of insiders in firms mandated to increase their level of transparency in corporate reports due to SFAS 131 adoption. Consistent with an information channel, such an effect is concentrated among firms with low ex-ante financial reporting quality and high ex-ante investors’ uncertainty. I do not find support for governance/monitoring or proprietary cost channels. Finally, in a sub-sample where crowding out effect of increased disclosure is more likely, I find that profitability of insider purchase trades increased after SFAS 131 adoption. Overall, this paper documents substantial information benefits of improved segment reporting to outside investors, limiting insiders’ information advantage in trading stocks of their own companies.
