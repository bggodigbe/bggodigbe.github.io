I stand on the shoulders of these giants.

My primary research interests are in financial reporting quality and corporate transparency. I have worked on topics examining transparency in corporate segment reporting and insider trading as well as mergers and acquisitions. One of my recent studies explores the implications of information transfers for regulating corporate disclosures.

I received my PhD in Accounting in 2021 from City University of Hong Kong. Before pursuing my doctoral program, I completed my master's degree in mainland China, following my undergraduate studies in Ghana.
