I owe a lot of my career progression to Todd. He is interested, present, involved and provides lots of guidance when I am at my wits end. More to follow soon...

This study examines whether firm networks can serve as a medium  to propagate financial reporting behavior. We find that earnings quality among firms is low when board networks are channels of incorrect information transmission (including earnings management information). Earnings quality is better for firms with good performance in spite of their networks. These results are robust to controlling for firm information environment and governance quality.
